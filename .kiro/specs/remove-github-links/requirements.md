# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves removing GitHub links from the Projects component and replacing them with enhanced live demo and download functionality. The goal is to streamline the project showcase by focusing on user-accessible content rather than source code repositories.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to access live demos or downloads of projects, so that I can experience the actual work rather than just viewing source code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the projects section THEN the system SHALL display live demo links instead of GitHub links
2. WHEN a user clicks on a project action button THEN the system SHALL redirect to either a live demo or download link
3. WHEN a project has a downloadable game THEN the system SHALL provide a download button with appropriate labeling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a portfolio owner, I want to remove all GitHub-related code and dependencies, so that the component is cleaner and focused on showcasing finished products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component renders THEN the system SHALL NOT display any GitHub icons or links
2. WHEN the component imports dependencies THEN the system SHALL NOT import GitHub-related icons from lucide-react
3. WHEN project data is defined THEN the system SHALL NOT include github properties in project objects

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want clear action buttons that indicate what I can do with each project, so that I understand my options for interacting with the work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project has a live demo THEN the system SHALL display a "Live Demo" button with an external link icon
2. WHEN a project has a downloadable file THEN the system SHALL display a "Download" button with an appropriate download icon
3. WHEN a project has both demo and download options THEN the system SHALL display both buttons clearly labeled
4. WHEN a project has neither demo nor download available THEN the system SHALL display a "Coming Soon" or similar placeholder

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the code, I want the project data structure to be consistent and type-safe, so that there are no runtime errors or TypeScript issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN project objects are defined THEN the system SHALL use consistent property names across all projects
2. WHEN TypeScript compiles the component THEN the system SHALL NOT produce any type errors related to missing properties
3. WHEN the component accesses project properties THEN the system SHALL only access properties that exist on all project objects
