# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves reorganizing the portfolio projects section to promote four specific projects to "Featured Projects" status and improving mobile navigation functionality. The current structure has only one featured project (VR Assessment Game), but we need to expand this to include Raturu Home Fever, Outbreak, and Cyber Security Learning Web as featured projects alongside the existing VR Assessment Game. Additionally, the mobile navigation for the "Other Projects" tabbed interface needs to be fixed to work properly on mobile devices.
