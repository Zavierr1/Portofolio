# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines the reorganization of the portfolio projects section to feature four key projects prominently while improving mobile navigation functionality. The solution maintains the existing visual design language while restructuring the content hierarchy and fixing mobile interaction issues.

## Architecture

### Current Structure Analysis
- Single featured project (VR Assessment Game) with dedicated `FeaturedProjectCard` component
- Remaining projects in tabbed "Other Projects" interface
- Mobile navigation issues in the tabbed interface
- Consistent `InteractiveMedia` component for all projects

### Proposed Structure
- Multiple featured projects section with grid/carousel layout
- Reduced "Other Projects" section with remaining projects
- Enhanced mobile touch interactions
- Preserved component reusability

## Components and Interfaces

### Enhanced Featured Projects Section

**FeaturedProjectsGrid Component**
```typescript
interface FeaturedProjectsGridProps {
  projects: Project[];
}
```

**Layout Strategy:**
- Desktop: 2x2 grid layout for four featured projects
- Tablet: 2x2 or 1x4 depending on screen size
- Mobile: Single column stack

**Visual Design:**
- Maintain current `FeaturedProjectCard` styling
- Consistent spacing and sizing across all featured projects
- Preserve hover/touch video preview functionality

### Mobile Navigation Improvements

**Enhanced Tab Navigation:**
- Improved touch target sizes (minimum 44px height)
- Better scroll behavior for horizontal tab list
- Enhanced visual feedback for active states
- Proper touch event handling

**Touch Interaction Fixes:**
- Replace hover-only interactions with touch-friendly alternatives
- Add proper `onTouchStart`/`onTouchEnd` handlers
- Implement proper mobile video preview controls
- Ensure tab switching works on touch devices

### Project Data Reorganization

**Featured Projects Array:**
```typescript
const featuredProjects = [
  vrProjectData,
  outbreakData, 
  raturuData,
  cyberSecurityData
];
```

**Remaining Projects:**
- Freaky Hollow
- RUUUNNN  
- Ultimate Rizzler

## Data Models

### Project Interface (Unchanged)
```typescript
interface Project {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  tech: string[];
  image: string;
  video?: string;
  download?: string;
}
```

### Component Props
```typescript
interface FeaturedProjectsGridProps {
  projects: Project[];
}

interface MobileTabNavigationProps {
  projects: Project[];
  selectedIndex: number;
  onTabSelect: (index: number) => void;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Image/Video Loading
- Maintain existing fallback image system
- Add error boundaries for video playback failures
- Graceful degradation when videos fail to load

### Mobile Compatibility
- Feature detection for touch capabilities
- Fallback interactions for devices without proper touch support
- Progressive enhancement approach

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Ensure proper layout at all screen sizes
- Handle edge cases for very small or very large screens
- Maintain accessibility at all breakpoints

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Regression Testing
- Screenshot comparison for featured projects grid
- Layout verification across different screen sizes
- Component rendering consistency

### Mobile Testing
- Touch interaction verification on actual devices
- Tab navigation functionality on mobile browsers
- Video preview behavior on touch devices
- Scroll behavior testing

### Accessibility Testing
- Keyboard navigation for tab interface
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management in tabbed interface
- Color contrast verification

### Cross-browser Testing
- Mobile Safari touch event handling
- Android Chrome compatibility
- Desktop browser hover states
- Video playback across browsers

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Data Reorganization
- Extract featured projects from main array
- Update project filtering logic
- Maintain existing project data structure

### Phase 2: Featured Projects Layout
- Create responsive grid system for featured projects
- Implement proper spacing and sizing
- Ensure consistent visual treatment

### Phase 3: Mobile Navigation Fixes
- Enhance tab button touch targets
- Improve horizontal scroll behavior
- Fix touch event handling for project switching

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
- Cross-device testing
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility verification

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Lazy loading for project images/videos
- Efficient re-rendering for tab switches
- Optimized mobile scroll performance

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels for tab navigation
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader announcements for content changes

### Browser Compatibility
- Touch event polyfills if needed
- CSS Grid fallbacks for older browsers
- Video element compatibility checks
